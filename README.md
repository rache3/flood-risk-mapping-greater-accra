Flood Risk Assessment using DEM data and Earth Observation tools (GEE + QGIS) for Greater Accra
# 🌊 Flood Risk Assessment: Greater Accra Region, Ghana

A project to map flood-prone areas in the Greater Accra Region using Earth Observation data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and QGIS. This study integrates Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with administrative boundaries to assess vulnerability.

## Tools Used
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** – DEM data sourcing and raster analysis
- **QGIS** – Visualization, classification, and layout map design
- **GitHub** – Project documentation and hosting

## Key Files
- `gee_floodrisk_script.py` – Earth Engine Python code used to generate elevation-derived flood layers
- `GreaterAccra_districts.geojson` – District boundaries used for masking
- `flood_risk_accra.tif` – Clipped raster file of DEM-based risk
- `DEM_Flood_Risk_Assessment.jpeg` – Final map layout
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Insights
- Low elevation coastal areas like **Weija-Gbawe** and **La-Nkwantanang-Madina** are at higher flood risk.
- DEM reveals flood-prone gradients that align with urban sprawl patterns.
